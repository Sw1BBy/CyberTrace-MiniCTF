<p>Well, it's time to stop coding. I hate having to code 24 hours a day just for a simple framework update to crash my project once again. I got tired of it and decided to take a break. I made a simple corn farm in a place far, far away and unseen. I also left a secret message there for those with keen eyes.

Will you be able to find me? If so, tell me the secret message for free goodies!</p>
