<p>While walking, I came across an unfamiliar yet familiar scene. I took a picture of it and posted it on Google Maps so that others could recognize it. It may be a hunch, but I feel like my post is going to blow up online.

If it does, could you prove it by providing my name?
(The person who posted the 360Â° image on Google Maps.)</p>
