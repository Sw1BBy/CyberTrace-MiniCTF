<p>Guys… tragic news. My EUROPEAN GOLDFINCH escaped its cage on 06/16. Last seen living its best life in Panama, probably checking into a 5-star hotel. If you’re there and spot a tiny bird ordering room service, tell it to pack up and come home—cage included. It’s got zero loyalty, just tiny wings and big dreams.</p>
