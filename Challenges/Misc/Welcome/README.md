<p>Welcome to Cyber MINI CTF, challenger! 
Prepare your brain, warm up your terminal, and get ready to suffer—uh, I mean LEARN.</p>

<p>In this world of puzzles, flags, and fake hints, only the curious will survive.
Remember, every challenge hides a secret… sometimes in plain sight, sometimes buried deep like ancient <b>LATIN </b>inscriptions.</p>
